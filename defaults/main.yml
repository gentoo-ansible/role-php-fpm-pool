# Hash of process manager parameters.
#
#  mode   Process manager mode (required). Choose how the process manager will
#         control the number of child processes. Possible values are:
#         : static   - a fixed number of child processes.
#         : dynamic  - the number of child processes are set dynamically.
#         : ondemand - no children are created at startup; children will be
#                      forked when new requests will connect. [default]
# All modes:
#    max_children        The number of child processes to be created when mode
#                        is 'static', or the maximum number of processes when
#                        mode is 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'. This value sets the
#                        limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will
#                        be served. Default is 10.
# Dynamic mode:
#    start_servers       The number of children processes created on startup.
#                        Set to '-1' to adjust this parameter based on:
#                        min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2
#    min_spare_servers   The desired minimum number of children processes in
#                        'idle' state. If less than this number, then some
#                        children will be created. Default is 1.
#    max_spare_servers   The desired maximum number of children processes in
#                        'idle' state. If greater than this number, then some
#                        children will be killed. Default is 6.
# On-demand mode:
#    process_idle_timeout   The number of seconds after which an idle process
#                           will be killed.
